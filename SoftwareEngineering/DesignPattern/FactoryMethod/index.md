Factory Method pattern
===

<img src='./.img/FactoryMethod.jpg' style="background-color: white; padding: 10px;"/>

Creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

- [C#](./csharp/FactoryMethod.cs)
- [Typescript](./typescript/FactoryMethod.ts)
